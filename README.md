**The idea is from [@ServerStatus](https://github.com/ServerStatus1)**
## Roles
There are 3 different roles defined in the [user.json](https://github.com/vince-vibin/spam-bot/blob/master/users.json) file
### ultra
Users with the ultra ranked cant be spammed. If you try to spam them you will get spammed back 50 times.
Also there spamlimit with one command is 100 messages.
#### spammerPremium

But he has a spamlimit of 50 messages in one command.
#### throns
Thorns cant be spammed just like the ultra but just like standart rank it has a spamlimit of 20 messages per command.
#### standard
The third role is standard and it is given to all users not definded in the [user.json](https://github.com/vince-vibin/spam-bot/blob/master/users.json) file.
